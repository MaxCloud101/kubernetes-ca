### 2.1 Kubernetes overview

What is kuberenetes?      

- Open-source container orchestration tool designed to automate, deploying, scaling, and operating containerized applications

Container orchestraion landscape

- There has been a surge in tools to support enterprises adopting containers in production
- We will compare Kubernetes with other tools to get a better undestanding
